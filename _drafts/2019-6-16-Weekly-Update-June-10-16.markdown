I breezed through an interesting book this week. The book is Barbara Oakley's *[A Mind for Numbers][mfn]*. Oakley, a co-creator of the legendary [Learning How to Learn MMOC][lhl], shares some tips on how to maximize the effects of learning, specifically focusing on concepts from math and science.. I really enjoyed the tips on procrastination.
