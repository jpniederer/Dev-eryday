I've been thinking about the structure of Dev-eryday. The way it's been structured for the longest time is that I must watch at least a few minutes of a tech tutorial video and do some kind of check in on GitHub each day. Most days I'll also take the opportunity to read a portion of a deep technical manual or textbook. These things are good tasks to do each day, but they can only push skills so far. In terms of in the weeds, hands-on learning, these check boxes leave quite a bit to be desired. There probably should have been a more formal stipulation to build and create each day, not just to passively learn. It's easy to fall into a routine of doing the minimum.

I read a lot this week. I finished two good books, *[The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness][hs]* and *[The Algebra of Happiness: Notes on the Pursuit of Success, Love, and Meaning][tah]*. Neither are directly related to software development, but I feel like they'll make me better at my craft.

## Finished

**Book(s):** *[The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness][hs]*, *[The Algebra of Happiness: Notes on the Pursuit of Success, Love, and Meaning][tah]*

## Currents

**Book(s):** *[Get Programming with F#: A Guide for .NET Developers][fs]*, *[The Master and Margarita][mam]*

## On the Next...

In the week ahead I'm going to start up a new challenge for the month of August, which is starting on Thursday. I didn't do a monthly challenge in July, so I should get back on track by committing to a monthly challenge for August. I've found that the best challenges are often the ones that are adjacent to my goals, so making the challenge be something related to making Dev-eryday more grounded in creating and building stuff would be something worth considering. Outside of the challenge, I'll keep on marching along on the current Dev-eryday style and learning as much as possible.
