I've always been interested in the potential of artificial intelligence. Are machines capable of  gaining general purpose intelligence? What are the repercussions of generally intelligent AIs? *[Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence][life]* by Max Tegmark takes a look at these questions and a lot more. I was captivated by this book this week. It poses some interesting questions about the future of life and technology. Some bad things could happen if we discover or create super intelligent machines, but it could be the step humanity needs to push us closer to infinite sustainability.

Aside from reading, I watched a quick course called [State of .NET: Executive Briefing][son] on Pluralsight. It paired quite nicely with the Build 2019 videos I've been watching on YouTube. The course may not present anything new for people up to date with everything .NET, but shares some high-level guidance on where .NET is right now and where it's going in the next few years. The point that garnered the most emphasis for the future is NET's recent evolution to being able to run anywhere. .NET 5 on all platforms is the future of the toolset.
