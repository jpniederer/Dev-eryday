I'm going to keep it brief this week. I'm feeling kind of lazy. I finished a book, *[The Hard Thing About Hard Things][hta]*, and a course, [Using React Hooks][urh]. The book was full of lessons that would be useful for CEOs of companies. I'm not sure there was a lot of takeaways for me. I liked that Bill Campbell, the focus of *The Trillion Dollar Coach*, was everywhere throughout the book. Campbell's reach is astounding. The course was great but I just audited the material. I really like what I've seen from React Hooks. Now I just need to sit down and spend some time with it. Hooks looks like a major improvement on the way state is handled in React components.

## Finished

**Online Course(s):** [Using React Hooks][urh]

**Book(s):** *[The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers][hta]*

## Currents

**Online Course(s):** [Writing Testable Code][wtc]

**Book(s):** *[Get Programming with F#: A Guide for .NET Developers][fs]*, *[C# in Depth][cid]*

## On the Next...

This week I'm not going to commit to anything for Dev-eryday. I'm sure I'll be active, but it's not going to be a priority. I've committed to a new monthly challenge for June that I'm calling "Drenched June." The concept is simple, every day of the month I will workout hard enough to get drenched. We're two days into June and I'm two for two far. It's going to be a fun month. The increased physical activity is going to raise the mind to new heights.
